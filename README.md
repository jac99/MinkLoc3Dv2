### Introduction
The paper presents a simple and effective learning-based method for computing a discriminative 3D point cloud descriptor for place recognition purposes. 
Recent state-of-the-art methods have relatively complex architectures such as multi-scale pyramid of point Transformers combined with a pyramid of feature aggregation modules.
Our method uses a simple and efficient 3D convolutional feature extraction, based on a sparse voxelized representation, enhanced with channel attention blocks. 
We employ recent advances in image retrieval and propose a modified version of a loss function based on a differentiable average precision approximation. Such loss function requires training with very large batches for the best results. This is enabled by using multistaged backpropagation.
Experimental evaluation on the popular benchmarks proves the effectiveness of our approach, with a consistent improvement over state of the art.

### Environment and Dependencies
Code was tested using Python 3.8 with PyTorch 1.10.1 and MinkowskiEngine 0.5.4 on Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 10.2.
Note: CUDA 11.1 is not recommended as there are some issues with MinkowskiEngine 0.5.4 on CUDA 11.1. 

The following Python packages are required:
* PyTorch (version 1.10.1)
* MinkowskiEngine (version 0.5.4)
* pytorch_metric_learning (version 1.1 or above)
* pandas
* wandb

Modify the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include absolute path to the project root folder: 
```export PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/.../MinkLoc3Dv2
```

### Datasets

**MinkLoc3Dv2** is trained on a subset of Oxford RobotCar and In-house (U.S., R.A., B.D.) datasets introduced in
*PointNetVLAD: Deep Point Cloud Based Retrieval for Large-Scale Place Recognition* paper ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03492)).
There are two training datasets:
- Baseline Dataset - consists of a training subset of Oxford RobotCar
- Refined Dataset - consists of training subset of Oxford RobotCar and training subset of In-house

For dataset description see PointNetVLAD paper or github repository ([link](https://github.com/mikacuy/pointnetvlad)).

You can download training and evaluation datasets from 
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rflmyfZ1v9cGGH0RL4qXRrKhg-8A-U9q) 
([alternative link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-1HA9Etw2PpZ8zHd3cjrfiZa8xzbp41J/view?usp=sharing)). 

Before the network training or evaluation, run the below code to generate pickles with positive and negative point clouds for each anchor point cloud. 

```generate pickles
cd generating_queries/ 

# Generate training tuples for the Baseline Dataset
python generate_training_tuples_baseline.py --dataset_root <dataset_root_path>

# Generate training tuples for the Refined Dataset
python generate_training_tuples_refine.py --dataset_root <dataset_root_path>

# Generate evaluation tuples
python generate_test_sets.py --dataset_root <dataset_root_path>
```
`<dataset_root_path>` is a path to dataset root folder, e.g. `/data/pointnetvlad/benchmark_datasets/`.
Before running the code, ensure you have read/write rights to `<dataset_root_path>`, as training and evaluation pickles
are saved there. 

### Training

To train **MinkLoc3Dv2** model, download and decompress the dataset and generate training pickles as described above.
Edit the configuration file (`config_baseline_v2.txt` or `config_refined_v2.txt`). 
Set `dataset_folder` parameter to the dataset root folder.
If running out of GPU memory, decrease `batch_split_size` parameter value. 

To train the network, run:

```train baseline
cd training

# To train minkloc3d model on the Baseline Dataset
python train.py --config ../config/config_baseline_v2.txt --model_config ../models/minkloc3dv2.txt

# To train minkloc3d model on the Refined Dataset
python train.py --config ../config/config_refined_v2.txt --model_config ../models/minkloc3dv2.txt
```

### Pre-trained Models

Pretrained models are available in `weights` directory
- `minkloc3dv2_baseline.pth` trained on the Baseline Dataset 
- `minkloc3dv2_refined.pth` trained on the Refined Dataset 

### Evaluation

To evaluate pretrained models run the following commands:

```eval baseline
cd eval

# To evaluate the model trained on the Baseline Dataset
python evaluate.py --config ../config/config_baseline_v2.txt --model_config ../models/minkloc3dv2.txt --weights ../weights/minkloc3dv2_baseline.pth

# To evaluate the model trained on the Refined Dataset
python evaluate.py --config ../config/config_refined_v2.txt --model_config ../models/minkloc3dv2.txt --weights ../weights/minkloc3dv2_refined.pth
```
